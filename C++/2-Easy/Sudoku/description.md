**Sudoku Validation**

Sudoku is a number-placement puzzle. The objective is to fill a 9 × 9 grid with digits so that each column, each row, and each of the nine 3 × 3 sub-grids that compose the grid contains all of the digits from 1 to 9.

**Algorithm**

This algorithm should check if the given grid of numbers represents a correct solution to Sudoku.

**Example**

For the first example:

```markdown
grid = [[1, 3, 2, 5, 4, 6, 9, 8, 7],
        [4, 6, 5, 8, 7, 9, 3, 2, 1],
        [7, 9, 8, 2, 1, 3, 6, 5, 4],
        [9, 2, 1, 4, 3, 5, 8, 7, 6],
        [3, 5, 4, 7, 6, 8, 2, 1, 9],
        [6, 8, 7, 1, 9, 2, 5, 4, 3],
        [5, 7, 6, 9, 8, 1, 4, 3, 2],
        [2, 4, 3, 6, 5, 7, 1, 9, 8],
        [8, 1, 9, 3, 2, 4, 7, 6, 5]]
```

The output should be `solution(grid) = true;`

For the second example:

```markdown
grid = [[8, 3, 6, 5, 3, 6, 7, 2, 9],
        [4, 2, 5, 8, 7, 9, 3, 8, 1],
        [7, 9, 1, 2, 1, 4, 6, 5, 4],
        [9, 2, 1, 4, 3, 5, 8, 7, 6],
        [3, 5, 4, 7, 6, 8, 2, 1, 9],
        [6, 8, 7, 1, 9, 2, 5, 4, 3],
        [5, 7, 6, 9, 8, 1, 4, 3, 2],
        [2, 4, 3, 6, 5, 7, 1, 9, 8],
        [8, 1, 9, 3, 2, 4, 7, 6, 5]]
```

The output should be `solution(grid) = false.`

The output should be false: each of the nine 3 × 3 sub-grids should contain all of the digits from 1 to 9. These examples are represented in the image below.

**Input/Output**

- Execution time limit: 0.5 seconds (cpp)
- Memory limit: 1 GB
- Input: 2D array `grid` representing a 9 × 9 grid already filled with numbers from 1 to 9.
- Output: Boolean, true if the given grid represents a correct solution to Sudoku, false otherwise.

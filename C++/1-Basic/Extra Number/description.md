# Find the Unique Number

You're given three integers, `a`, `b` and `c`. It is guaranteed that two of these integers are equal to each other. What is the value of the third integer?

## Example

- For `a = 2`, `b = 7`, and `c = 2`, the output should be `solution(a, b, c) = 7`.

  The two equal numbers are `a` and `c`. The third number (`b`) equals 7, which is the answer.

## Input/Output

- [execution time limit] 0.5 seconds (cpp)
- [memory limit] 1 GB
- [input] integer a

  Guaranteed constraints:
  1 ≤ a ≤ 10^9.

- [input] integer b

  Guaranteed constraints:
  1 ≤ b ≤ 10^9.

- [input] integer c

  Guaranteed constraints:
  1 ≤ c ≤ 10^9.

- [output] integer
